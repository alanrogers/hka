The C++ source is in directory cppsrc.  The C source in in csrc.  In
either directory, rebuild by typing "make clean; make dep; make".
Either way, you will end up with an executable named "hka" that is
executed like this:

  Usage: hka filename

The two versions read the same input files and produce the same
output.  In the input files, comments go from '#' to end-of-line.  The
format of the other lines is as follows:

line 1 : number of loci (an integer)

remaining lines (1 per locus):
   col 1: name of locus
   col 2: number of nucleotide sites used within species A
   col 3: number of nucleotide sites used within species B
   col 4: number of nucleotide sites used in AB comparisons
   col 5: haploid sample size for A
   col 6: haploid sample size for B
   col 7: number of polymorphic sites for A
   col 8: number of polymorphic sites for B
   col 9: mean number of differences in AB comparisons

This is similar but not identical to the input format of Jody Hey's
program.  The output echoes its input and puts all the results into
comments.  Thus, the output will also serve as input.

Sample data files can be found in the "data" directory.
